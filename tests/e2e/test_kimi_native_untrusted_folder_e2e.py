``fix(kimi-native): first launch in an untrusted folder kills the session with
'Harness stream connection error.'``

The user journey
----------------
1. A ``kimi`` (Kimi Code, ``kimi-native``) session is launched against a
   brand-new directory the Kimi CLI has never seen before. Omnigent gives every
   task its own fresh git worktree, so **every** new worktree is a first launch.
2. On first launch in an untrusted folder the Kimi CLI parks on its interactive
   ``Trust this folder?`` modal before mounting its input box.
3. The user sends their first message from the web composer. The kimi-native
   harness delivers it by pasting into the resident TUI's tmux pane
   (:class:`omnigent.inner.kimi_native_executor.KimiNativeExecutor` →
   :func:`omnigent.kimi_native_bridge.inject_user_message`).
4. Nothing established workspace trust before the CLI started, and the harness's
   in-pane auto-accept never recognises the live modal, so the paste is
   swallowed by the unanswered trust gate: the first message is **silently
   dropped** and the session is unusable on first launch. In the deployed UI
   this surfaces as ``Harness stream connection error.`` / "The connection to
   the agent dropped mid-turn."

This test reproduces the failure against the **real** Kimi Code CLI and the
**real** harness turn path (no mock): it launches a bare ``kimi`` TUI in a fresh,
untrusted workspace exactly as the runner's ``_auto_create_kimi_terminal`` does,
then drives one web turn through ``KimiNativeExecutor.run_turn`` and asserts the
user's message actually reached the CLI.

* On the current build the first message is dropped (the ``Trust this folder?``
  modal blocks the pane and is never answered), so the assertion **fails** —
  this is the reproduction.
* Once trust is established before launch (or the modal is correctly answered),
  the message lands in the CLI and the assertion **passes** — this is the
  fix's fail→pass target.

The session-scoped ``KIMI_CODE_HOME`` is built with the real
:func:`omnigent.kimi_native_credentials.build_kimi_session_home` (the module the
recommended trust pre-seed fix targets), and the workspace is passed through when
the builder's signature accepts it, so a pre-seed fix flows through unchanged.

Real-binary test, gated on the ``kimi`` CLI and ``tmux`` being present; skipped
(not failed) otherwise so CI stays green without the upstream binary.
